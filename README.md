# Crowdfunding_ETL

Task was to build an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data.
First we transformed the data, and created four CSV files. Then used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. 
Finally, CSV files files were upload into a Postgres database to perform merge and analysis.

**Task 1 Requirements:**
Created the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
